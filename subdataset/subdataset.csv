Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes, concupiscence is a function of humanity, so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and, where required, forgiving.

It seems the grievances of all the different parties are so tangled and sometimes so deep, what diplomat could cut through those knots? What I learned was: Assad himself is probably not a monster, but a weak man co-opted by the people his father left in government. Some of the conflict is based on religious sectarianism and memories of the slaughter of Islamic Brotherhood supporters back in the '80s. The rebels would be far worse than Assad if they won. And the blasted Americans and the West armed those rebels because they wanted Assad out, because of Syria's historic association with Russia and enemies of Israel. That said, it is not true that America and the West at this point have no stake in this conflict: the millions fleeing Syria HAVE destabilized North Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

Lee effectively ended the war by surrendering and kept it from restarting 2 years later by talking down those southerners who wanted to. He supported Johnson's plan for Reconstruction & became a symbol that aided its success. He was a productive, loyal member of American society the rest of his life. He was neither pro-secession nor vehemently pro-slavery. He was a complex man (supported black education but not the right to vote); a product of his time. Where Arnold was ticked off at America & out for revenge, Lee fought the Union out of loyalty to his state, which democratically voted to secede.

The one time the government tried to ban the drug of choice for white men, alcohol, white thugs invented the drive by shooting. Alcohol was made legal to solve the problem.

In other words, an apparent discrepancy disappears--Jesus accept divorce on the principles of Leviticus (adultery), and reject divorce as a male prerogative that can be exercised for any reason. And that leave Paul as the ONLY passage that has Jesus rejecting divorce without exception, and Paul demonstrated with his action, that the Church had the authority of override Jesus as Paul understood him.

Those relationships become radically different because he’s ordained.” Then goes on to talk about the problem of clericalism. “Unintentionally the Royal Commission echoed at Pope Francis who, speaking from a very different angle, has left no doubt that clericalism is a disease in the Church that needs to be treated and treated without delay,” the Archbishop said.

"No, just some woman got the crap scared out of her. That wasn't injurous at all, I'm sure. Statistically, people who are at home during a burglary have a high chance of being injured or killed and that chance increases significantly if they are NOT armed. Having a gun and knowing how to use it (which this woman clearly did not) significantly increases your chance of survival. I'm sorry the burglar wasn't hurt, because he'll spend a few years in jail and be out doing this again soon. He probably won't even be charged with the appropriate crime ... which should be attempted murder. When someone burglarizes a house when people are home, they signal their desire to kill those they find within those walls. This is why it's legal to shoot an intruder, because they have signaled that your life is meaningless to them and in doing so they have ceded their own right to life.

After all, the KKK cloak represents religious purity, prejudice against homosexuals, anti-semitism - and so does the niqab, all over the world, without exception. But the niqab means feminism and modesty in Canada (just Canada). I'm still waiting for the Globe's piece in the Life section with three Klansmen pushing their kids on swings in the park - they just wear the cloak for modesty and to represent their faith, nothing to do with support of violence towards homosexuals and Jews... does this sound ridiculous, because it is - let's defend a symbol that is synonymous with violence against homosexuals - as the niqab is most common in countries that punish homosexuality with jail or worse (often the death penalty). But in Canada it means modesty and independence - the niqab's supporters are pathetic. Let's encourage a symbol that is only common in countries where women are treated like second class citizens...",0.6,female

You obviously do not know that history records Bill Clinton pointing his finger at the American people and swearing emphatically on national television, “I did not have sex with that woman!” He also lied to a judge under oath about the matter. The “stained blue dress” is what proved him a predator, a national disgrace and liar, got him convicted for lying to a judge, and led to his impeachment.

Thank you again Mr. Cole for a timely reminder of how cynical and politically opportune Lisa Murkowski is and has been. Being a Republican senator in the McConnell obstructionist/do nothing era must be a very difficult high wire act but good lord she ran as an independent when the GOP abandoned her for Miller. Thousands of Dems and Indys wrote in her name out of fear of Miller but then immediately abandoned the indy platform for advancement back inside the bowels of the Republican party. Her four different excuses for not calling for hearings and votes on Judge Garland's appointment to the SCOTUS was disgusting to observe. That in the wake of the release of the obviously fraudulent Planned Parenthood videos she would call for an investigation rather than call out the goons who created them was cringe worthy.

Here is my conclusion; Trump will be declared the official winner of the 2016 election. Again. Foreign meddling, if any, will be determined to have had little or no effect on the outcome of the election. Mueller, like his friend James Comey, will be forced to admit there were mistakes made, but 'no reasonable prosecutor' would bring charges, The real investigation needs to focus on actual voter registration rules and that existing election laws are enforced in every state in the future",0.0,general

"It is blind obedience [and stupidity] not to challenge both the theological rationale in both the Catechism and Canon Law. I teach church history---the concept of celibacy was first brought up by Spanish synods in the 4th Century. But this concept was not widely enforced. Pope Siracus believed that engaging in sexual contact [and remember that priests, bishops and popes were married], caused a minister of the altar to be 'impure' in celebrating the Liturgy. He insisted that in Rome all priests be celibate. Eventually, by the year 1000 AD this became the practice and DISCIPLINE in the Church. In the Apostolic times---and the Apostles themselves, were married. Married love and sexuality is not dirty, impure, demeaning or any other degrading term. In our time, any concepts such as this should be condemned to the hilt. AND, we have absolutely NO EVIDENCE that Jesus was not married [he could have been a widower]. It was the task of Jewish parents to secure a wife for their sons.",0.5,general
