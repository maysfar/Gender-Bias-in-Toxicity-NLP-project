Create a comprehensive gendered word-pair dictionary that I can use for data augmentation in toxicity detection.
Make sure each pair appears only once. Keep true male–female opposites such as family roles, professions, pronouns, and titles. Also include insults, slang, and anatomy-based words that are often used in toxic comments. Add modern internet tropes and archetypes that show up in social media. Make sure to cover honorifics and pronouns. . The goal is to end up with a single, cleaned dictionary that contains strict male↔female pairs, relevant insults/slang, and modern cultural archetypes.
